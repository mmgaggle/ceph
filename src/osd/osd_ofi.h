/**
 * Out-of-band delivery over libfabric.
 *
 * Serves delivery tokens of the form ceph::ofi::token_t describes
 * ("<base>:<size>:ofi1:<provider>:<endpoint>:<key>") whose provider is
 * the one this OSD runs (osd_ofi_provider). The provider picks the
 * wire: tcp or shm need no special hardware, verbs runs RC under the
 * rxm utility provider, efa runs SRD, and a UET provider runs Ultra
 * Ethernet. The window owner never inserts this OSD into its address
 * vector, so any OSD holding the token can write, as with cuObject's DC
 * transport.
 *
 * When the OSD has it lend the gather windows (osd_oob_gather, see
 * OSDService::oob_next_lends()), the executor also registers them: a
 * pool of osd_oob_window_count windows of osd_oob_window_size bytes open
 * to remote writes, which shards of an erasure-coded read push into.
 * With osd_oob_rekey_windows, a window gets a new memory key when it is
 * released, so that no write meant for an earlier gather, a provider's
 * late duplicate included, lands in it once it is lent again.
 *
 * With osd_oob_pull, the endpoint also asks the provider for RMA reads,
 * and the executor pulls the payload of a write out of the client's
 * window (an OSD-direct PUT): see OSDOobExecutor::execute_pull().
 *
 * When a cut-off fails, writes may land in a client's window after the
 * client was told they would not (see ceph::ofi::Endpoint::write()). The
 * executor then stops: it serves no token and lends no window, logs to
 * the cluster log once, and raises the OOB_DELIVERY_UNSAFE health alert.
 * With osd_oob_cutoff_failure set to abort, the OSD exits instead, which
 * ends the writes of a software provider and makes a device drop the
 * queue pair's. A quick cut-off that ends later than
 * osd_oob_cutoff_late_tolerance fails only with
 * osd_oob_cutoff_late_fail_closed; otherwise the executor logs it to the
 * cluster log, raises OOB_CUTOFF_PAST_TOLERANCE, and goes on.
